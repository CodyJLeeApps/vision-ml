# vision-ml
This application works as a Vision MachineLearning app to determine the main item within a photo.
The user will open the app, frame the photo within the live preview (video) screen, and tap the screen to take the photo and see the results.

Once the result is determined, it will be displayed on the screen, as well as spoken by the speech synthesizer.
